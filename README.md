This is my second project. realyse that class component structer cause allot of spagheti code, i started learning Hooks.

## Things i learn

*How to make basic state container using hooks (react-store-with-reducer repo)


### `Functional Components`

*How to work with functional components \
*Differences betwen class components app and functional component app

## Dificulties in creating this project

Newest version of api project causes alot of problem with data< that came from api. realise that i need to make code harder (as functional and as understadably) i switch to old api version.
